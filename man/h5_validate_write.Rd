\title{Validate what would be written where (pre-flight check)}
\usage{
h5_validate_write(h5, values, ts_cols = c("time", "value"))
}
\arguments{
\item{h5}{An open \code{hdf5r::H5File}.}

\item{values}{Named list of values to write (names are HDF5 paths).}

\item{ts_cols}{Character(2). Column names for TS (default time/value).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Summarizes for each path:
\itemize{
\item current dataset dims/maxdims (HDF5 order)
\item intended value shape (R order)
\item intended write shape (HDF5 order; for TS always 2xN)
\item decision: SKIP / WRITE / RESIZE / NEED_RECREATE / ERROR
}
}
\details{
Notes:
\itemize{
\item 2-column data.frames/tibbles are treated as Nx2 in R and mapped to 2xN in HDF5.
\item Many RAINDROP files store time series as HDF5 dims 2xN (appearing as Nx2 in R).
